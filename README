= RubyDiff

RubyDiff does higher level comparisons of ruby code.

When looking at large sets of changes between versions of files, it is 
important to get an idea of what classes, modules, and methods change.
RubyDiff aims to reveal substantive changes to code, and let you ignore
trivial changes like whitespace being added to a document.

== Requirements
RubyDiff depends on ParseTree, the easiest way to get it is via ruby gems:
  ruby gem install parse_tree
  
== Caveats
This is just the beginnings of an experiment, so all that is captured are
changes to instance methods.  The API is likely to change drastically.

== Usage
This is likely to change a bunch, but for the moment:
  ruby ruby_diff.rb old_file new_file
Or for git repositories
  ruby ruby_diff.rb --git old_revision new_revision path
